# 📊 Data Science Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Data Science Practice Repository**!  
This repository is a collection of projects and notebooks where I practice and showcase the **fundamentals of data science**.  

The goal of this repo is to:
- Build a solid foundation in **data analysis, visualization, and machine learning**.
- Practice real-world workflows using datasets (starting with the **Titanic dataset**).
- Document and share my learning journey as I grow my data science skills.

## 🔎 What’s Inside?
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
  - Identifying missing values, outliers, and data imbalances.
  - Insights and visualizations using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:**
  - Handling missing values and outliers.
  - Encoding categorical variables.
  - Feature scaling and transformation.
  - Creating new features (e.g., family size, passenger titles in Titanic).

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and more.
  - Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
