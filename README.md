# 📊 Data Science Portfolio

This repository showcases my work in **data science, analytics, and machine learning**.  
It contains well-documented Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate my ability to **analyze data, extract insights, and build predictive models**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Apply **core data science techniques** on real datasets.
- Perform **end-to-end analysis**: from raw data → insights → modeling.
- Develop a structured workflow that highlights both **technical skills** and **business-oriented thinking**.
- Build a portfolio that reflects my growth in **data science and applied machine learning**.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Statistical summaries and data distributions.
  - Handling missing values, outliers, and skewed data.
  - Visualizations for univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.

- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:**
  - Encoding categorical variables.
  - Feature scaling and transformations.
  - Creating new features to improve predictive power.

- **Machine Learning:**
  - Implementation of baseline and advanced models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.).
  - Model evaluation using multiple metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC).
  - Comparison of models and selection of the best-performing pipeline.
